# Spotifast

**Spotify, native and fast.** Spotifast is a Spotify client written in
Rust with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). It plays music through
[librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot), typically uses
100–250 MB of RAM, starts in well under a second, and has no browser engine.
It runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

**Playback needs Spotify Premium.** Free accounts can browse and search, but
cannot play music through Spotifast.
